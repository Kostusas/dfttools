Welcome to DFT Tools' documentation!
=====================================

DFT Tools is a python library for parsing, post-processing
and presenting numerical data generated by simulation codes in physics
and chemistry. The abbreviation 'DFT' comes from the `denisty function
theory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory>`_
being implemented in these codes.

With DFT Tools you will be able to:

    * parse numerical data from textual output such as band structures,
      data on the grid, etc.;
    * manipulate the data: build supercells, calculate density of states,
      etc.;
    * visualise the data;
